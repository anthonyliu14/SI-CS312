1. When is "this" used? Is it implicit or explicit?

2. Add the following method to the Point class:

public double slope(Point other)

Returns the slope of the line drawn between this Point and the given other Point. 
Use the formula (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) to determine the slope between two points (
x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Note that this formula fails for points with identical 
x-coordinates, so throw an IllegalArgumentException in this case.


public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
    // // your code goes here
    
}

3. Add the following method to the TimeSpan class:


public void add(TimeSpan span)
Adds the given amount of time to this time span.

Recall the TimeSpan code from this chapter:


public class TimeSpan {
    private int hours;
    private int minutes;
    
    public void add(int hours, int minutes) { ... }
    public int getHours() { ... }
    public int getMinutes() { ... }
    public String toString() { ... }
â€‹
    // // your code goes here
    
}

4. Add the following method to the Point class:

public int manhattanDistance(Point other)

Returns the "Manhattan distance" between the current Point object and the given 
other Point object. The Manhattan distance refers to how far apart two places are 
if the person can only travel straight horizontally or vertically, as though 
driving on the streets of Manhattan. In our case, the Manhattan distance is the sum 
of the absolute values of the differences in their coordinates; in other words, the 
difference in x plus the difference in y between the points.


public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
    // // your code goes here
    
}

5. Add the following method to your Point class:

public boolean isVertical(Point other)

Returns true if the given Point lines up vertically with this Point; that is, if 
their x coordinates are the same.
