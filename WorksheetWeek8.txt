1. Consider the following method. For each of the four points labeled by comments
and each of the four assertions in the table, write whether the assertion is always 
true, sometimes true, or never true at that point in the code. Abbreviate always 
with an A, sometimes with an S and never with an N.


public static int assertionPractice(int a, int b) {
	int result = -1;
	// POINT A
	if(a > 0 && b > 0) {
		while(a != b) {
			// POINT B
			if(a > b) {
				a -= b;
			}
			else {
				b -= a;
			}
		}
		result = a;
		// POINT C
	}
	// POINT D
	return result;
}

Abbreviate always with an A, sometimes with an S and never with an N.

		| result == b 	  |		b > a 		|		result == -1 	|	a == b 	   |

Point A |			  |				|				|		   |

Point B |			  |				|				|		   |

Point C |			  |				|				|		   |

Point D |			  |				|				|		   |

2. . Write a method tokensPerLine. The method has one parameter, a Scanner object.
The Scanner is already connected to a file. The file contains at least one line. The method returns the average number of tokens (based on whitespace) per line.

For example, if the Scanner object was connected to the following file,

10 cat 20
30

50 20cat20
cat
dog 32

then the method would return 1.5 (9 / 6).
The given file contains 9 tokens (10, cat, 20, 30, 50, 20cat20, cat, dog, and 32)
and has 6 lines. There is one blank line with no tokens between the line that 
contains 30 and the line that contains 50 20cat20. You may only use Scanner objects
and the constructors and methods from the Scanner class. You may not use any other 
Java classes or methods in your answer. Write the complete method, including the 
header, below:



3. Write a method named evenNumbers that accepts a Scanner as a parameter reading 
input from a file containing a series of integers, and report various statistics 
about the integers. You may assume that there is at least one integer in the file. 
Report the total number of numbers, the sum of the numbers, the count of even 
numbers and the percent of even numbers. For example, if a Scannerinput on file 
numbers.txt contains the following text:

5 7 2 8 9 10 12 98 7 14 20 22

then the call evenNumbers(input); should produce the following output:

12 numbers, sum = 214
8 evens (66.67%)


4. Write a method named boyGirl that accepts a Scanner as a parameter. The Scanner 
is reading its input from a file containing a series of names followed by integers. 
The names alternate between boys' names and girls' names. Your method should 
compute the absolute difference between the sum of the boys' integers and the sum 
of the girls' integers. The input could end with either a boy or girl; you may not 
assume that it contains an even number of names. If the input file tas.txt contains 
the following text

Steve 3 Sylvia 7 Craig 14 Lisa 13 Brian 4 Charlotte 9 Jordan 6

then your method could be called in the following way:

Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("tas.txt"));
boyGirl(input);
and should produce the following output, since the boys' sum is 27 and the girls' 
sum is 29:

4 boys, 3 girls
Difference between boys' and girls' sums: 2
