1. Which of the following is the correct syntax to draw a rectangle?
	a) g.draw.rectangle(10, 20, 50, 30);
	b) g.drawRect(x = 10, y = 20, width = 50, height = 30);
	c) Graphics.drawRect(10, 20, 50, 30);
	d) g.drawRect(10, 20, 50, 30);
	e) Graphics g.drawRect(10, 20, 50, 30);

2. Consider the following program:

import java.awt.*;
â€‹
public class Draw7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DrawingPanel panel = new DrawingPanel(200, 200);
        Graphics g = panel.getGraphics();
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            g.drawOval(i * 10, i * 10, 200 - (i * 10), 200 - (i * 10));
        }
    }
}

What graphical output figure will be drawn by the Draw7 program (Draw the shape / pattern of it)?

3. The following code attempts to draw a filled black outer rectangle with a white filled inner circle inside it:

DrawingPanel panel = new DrawingPanel(200, 100);
Graphics g = panel.getGraphics();
g.setColor(Color.WHITE);
g.fillOval(10, 10, 50, 50);
g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
g.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);

However, it is incorrect. Find the mistakes and correct the code.


4. Write a complete program in a class named MickeyBox that uses the DrawingPanel to draw the following figure (see image in github):

The window is 220 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall. The background is yellow. There are two blue ovals of size 40 x 40 pixels. The left oval's top-left corner is located at position (50, 25), and the two ovals' top-left corners are 80 pixels apart horizontally. There is a red square whose top two corners exactly intersect the centers of the two ovals. Lastly, there is a black horizontal line through the center of the square.

5. Write a method called printNumbers that accepts a maximum number as a parameter and prints each number from 1 up to that maximum, inclusive, boxed by square brackets. For example, consider the following calls:

printNumbers(5);
printNumbers(7);

These calls should produce the following output:
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]

6. Write a method called printStrings that accepts a String and a number of repetitions as parameters and prints that String the given number of times. For example, the call:


printStrings("abc", 5);
will print the following output:

abcabcabcabcabc
