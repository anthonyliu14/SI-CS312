1. How is a program ran / executed?
2. Which of the following identifiers are valid?
    a. I-LoVe-PuShEEn
    b. i_LoVe_PusHeeN
    c. $$Pusheen$$
    d. _Pusheencute
    e. 1LovePusheen
    f. 1_LovePusheen
    g. Pusheen+Me
    h. pusheen.cute
    i. pusheenIsCute
    j. puHseeniscUTe
3. From the valid identifiers in the previous questions, which of them are "recommended" to use? Be able to explain 
your reasoning as to why one is good / why one isn't!






4. Evaluate the following expressions:
    a. 12 + "CS" + "\"" + 1 + "E"
    b. 82617 / 1000 % 10 + 3 * 10 
    c. 1.5 + 6 / 4 + 2.5
    d. 117 % 100 + 2 * 100 * 3 % 50
    e. 29 / 4 / 2.0 + 18 / 5 + 1.5
    f. "UT" + "POP" + 3 * 5
    g. 3 + 4 + "UT" + 5 + 6 + "POP" + 1 / 5
    h. 3 * 2 + "C++" + 2 + 1
    i. 1.5 * 3 / 2 + 2 * 3
    j. 1 + 2 + "UT" + 2 + 1 
5. Write a program that prints out “I wish we were good at football” 27 times. Make sure you use methods to make 
your code less redundant: i.e do not print out “I wish we were good at football” with 27 println statements.
6. Mike Scott has GACKED at the following code. Stylistcally, what's bad about it (what made him gack)?

public class hello {

	int a=19;
public static void main(String[] args) {

	}

	public static void Multiply(int x, int y) {
		System.out.println(x*y);
	}

// pusheen says hi wassup guys.
public static void $$pusheensayshi$$(int x, int y) {
  int sum = x-y;
System.out.println(sum);
  }
	public static void printNumber {
		  System.out.println(a);
	}

	  public static void printCircleArea(int diameter) {
    System.out.println(3.14*diameter);
	}

    }
